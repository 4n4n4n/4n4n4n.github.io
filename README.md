<h3 id="intro" style="color:blue;">Introduction</h3>

Hello! I'm a final-year Data Science student, also majoring in Mathematics. I am still figuring out what I really like. My educational background gives me solid foundation in algorithms and mathematics. I enjoy the "ah-ha" moment when I finally understand something after a period of pondering.
